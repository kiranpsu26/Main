Waits in Selenium, how do you handle synchronization in selnium
need of waits in selenium


our script will be very fast, but the application pr the Ui on whcih we will working on
will be slow when compared to Ui or the application. 


driver.finElement(By.xpath("xpath")).click();  // open a new page
//wait
driver.finElement(By.xpath("xpath")).click();  // on new page i need to click



4types of waits
have different functions

1. Implicit wait
2.Explicit wait
3.fluent wait
4. static wait.

Impicit wait:- is also called as global wait,
The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a 
certain amount of time before it throws a “No Such Element Exception”. 
The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will 
wait for the element for that time before throwing an exception.


Implicit wait will accept 2 parameters, the first parameter will accept the time 
as an integer value and the second parameter will accept the time measurement in 
terms of SECONDS, MINUTES, MILISECOND, MICROSECONDS, NANOSECONDS, DAYS, HOURS, etc.



Explicit wait:-
The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain conditions 
(Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceeded before throwing “ElementNotVisibleException”
 exception. It is an intelligent kind of wait, but it can be applied only for specified elements.
  It gives better options than implicit wait as it waits for


The NoSuchElementException is an unchecked exception in Java that can be thrown 
by various accessor methods to indicate that the element being requested does not exist.
element not being present on the ui or xpath issue

ElementNotVisibleException
Thrown to indicate that although an element is present on the DOM, 
it is not visible, and so is not able to be interacted with.
it might be below the screen  i.e you need to perfrom a scroll 

alertIsPresent()
elementSelectionStateToBe()
elementToBeClickable()
elementToBeSelected()
frameToBeAvaliableAndSwitchToIt()
invisibilityOfTheElementLocated()
invisibilityOfElementWithText()
presenceOfAllElementsLocatedBy()
presenceOfElementLocated()
textToBePresentInElement()
textToBePresentInElementLocated()

driver.findElennet();
total time taken  25 sec

max time limit is 22sec

Fluent Wait in Selenium marks the maximum amount of time for Selenium WebDriver
 to wait for a certain condition (web element) becomes visible. It also defines how 
 frequently WebDriver will check if the condition appears before throwing the 
 “ElementNotVisibleException”.

Wait wait = new FluentWait(driver)
.withTimeout(20, SECONDS)
.pollingEvery(2, SECONDS)
.ignoring(Exception.class);




static wait:-

Thread.sleep(1000);
